## Get started with Linux.

# What is Linux?

We get many different opinions from different developers around the world on what is [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux), some say it is a [Kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system) and some say it is [Operating System(OS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system). Linux is both a Kernel and an Operating System that directly manages a system‚Äôs hardware and resources, like CPU, memory, and storage i.e. **Linux is an operating system‚Äôs kernel**.

This amazing video by Gary Explains can easily solve the doubt of whether Linux is a Kernel or a Operating System :

Linux is a free and the biggest open sources software project in the world. The most amazing fact about Linux is that anyone can run, learn, modify Linux according to your choice and even sell your version only when all the changes done are under [GNU General Public License (GPL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License). 

[There are several Linux Distributions](https://linuxhint.com/best-linux-distros-2022/): 

1.  **Ubuntu Linux**
2. **Zorin OS**
3. **Raspberry Pi OS**
4. **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**
5. **Fedora**

# What is a Command Line Interface(CLI)?
A [command-line interface (CLI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) is an operating system shell that uses alphanumeric characters typed on a keyboard to provide instructions and data to the operating system, interactively. 

When we talk about Command Line what we actually mean is ["Shell"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell). It follows give and take system i.e. it takes input in the form of commands from the keyboard gives it to the operating system to process it and gives output. [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell) is a very famous shell program from GNU Project.

The popular shells used in Linux are:

- C Shell (csh)
- Kron Shell (ksh)
- Z Shell(zsh)

This is how a Command-Line looks:

# Basic Linux Commands 
As mentioned above Shell is used to communicate with the operating system and that is done through commands(reserved keywords performing a specific function). In this post, I have divided the commands on the basis of beginner and intermediate level. 

General syntax of writing a Linux Command: 

**command -(options) argument1 argument2 ...**


**üö® Terminal is a case-sensitive platform so be careful while typing commands on command line.**


## Beginner Level Linux Commands 

**1. pwd:**

When you will open your terminal you will be in your home [directory](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/d/director.htm) of the computer system. It is comparatively hard in Command-Line to know in which directory you are then the [Graphical User Interface(GUI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface).
How to know when you are in which directory?  
The answer is "pwd" command which on running on the Command-Line gives you the exact location you are in with a complete path from the root directory.

```
pwd
``` 
On typing this command and pressing enter you will get an output on the console containing the result in which directory you are now, below is the example of "pwd" command :


![Screenshot 2022-04-03 at 7.18.11 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648993717709/bCmn521-X.png)
 
**2. mkdir and rmdir:**

The "mkdir" command is one of the most used command which is used to create a new directory.

```
mkdir (directory name)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 3.53.01 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649067812716/vVm6czi56.png)


The "rmdir" does the opposite of "mkdir" i.e. it deletes any directory of your choice.

```
rmdir (directory name)
``` 


![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 3.56.36 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649068022201/h9bJ5Ug7C.png)

There is more you can do with a command by using [Flags(or Options)](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=names-command-flags) with the commands to get more filtered information.

**Flags(or Options):**

**¬∑ mkdir -v and rmdir -v:**


The "mkdir -v" command is used to create more than one directory in a single command.
```
mkdir -v (directory names)

The "rmdir -v" does the opposite of "mkdir -v" i.e. it deletes multiple directories in single line.

```
rmdir -v (directory names)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-05 at 3.13.56 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649108685606/QMu9yq6ea.png)

**3. touch:**

The "touch" command is also similar to "mkdir" command the only difference is that this command is used to create new files instead of a directory.

```
touch (file name)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 4.19.00 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649069369680/elhrUKLzN.png)

**4. rm:**

The "rm" command works opposite to that of "touch" command i.e. it is used to delete the file.

```
rm (file name)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 4.34.05 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649070331193/htZX8M7dt.png)
 

**Flags(or Options):**

**¬∑ rm -i:**

The "-i" here stands for interactive mode i.e. it asks the user for confirmation before removing the
file, you have to press y for confirming the deletion, and any other key leaves the file un-deleted.

```
rm -i (file name)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-05 at 12.03.12 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649140415782/_J5f-8V60.png)

All the files starting with "." are hidden files.

**¬∑ ls -l:**
The "-l" flag is used to display more important information about the file in a long list format. Information such as file size, owner name, permissions, etc is displayed.

```
ls -l
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-05 at 12.15.29 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649141316833/yyu1bkDJ_.png)

**6. cd:**

The cd (‚Äúchange directory‚Äù) command is used to change the current working directory in Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. ‚Äúcd‚Äù expects the directory name or path of the new directory as input.


![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 3.26.05 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649023018993/6K4Om-MGe.png)
       

```
cd (directory name)
``` 

There is a rule which is followed by "cd" command that is the directory you want to move in should be present in your current directory or it will throw an error. In order to move from one directory to other directories you should go to the parent directory of the directory. 

Various ways of using "cd" commands are :

![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 3.35.24 AM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649023627929/lW_j8PLbD.png)

The "man" command is a very useful command as it is used to get complete information of other commands and use the information to carry out your task. It shows the [manual pages](https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-man) of the commands.

```
man (command)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-04 at 7.16.23 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649080012504/66MthxgZa.png)

The "mv -i" is the same as that of the "cp -i" command the only difference is that it does not work if files do not exist,  it simply renames it or moves it to a new location.  

**¬∑ cp -f and mv -f:**

The "-f" stands for force, if in any case user is not able to overwrite the file, the user can use this flag along with the "cp" command in order to overwrite the file forcefully. This comes in handy when user does not have the write permission to a file.

```
cp -f (file name) (file name)
``` 

![Screenshot 2022-04-05 at 3.10.46 PM.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1649151680688/QwALLFlVG.png)

The "mv -f" command is also the same as the "cp -f" command the only difference is it overrides the minor protection and overwrites the destination file forcefully and deletes the source file. 

**10. locate:**

The "locate" command as the name suggests is used to locate a file in your local system.

```
locate (file name)
```

## Intermediate Level Linux Commands 

**1. vim:**

The "vim" command is used to write content in the file. After typing the "vim" command followed by the file name a different window of the text editor will open. Press "i" to enter insert mode in the text editor, type the content you want to add or edit and press "esc" key to exit insert mode. The process is not yet completed you still need to save what you have changed in the file to do so you have to ":wq" to save and exit the text editor.

```
vim (file name)
``` 
After entering the command followed by the file name window like this will appear :

The "sudo" command always asks you to enter your system password to proceed because it is a very sensitive command.

```
sudo (command)
```
